      The main goal is to:
      - Return functional Playwright code.
      - Return step by step how the user persona navigated the product.
      - Return pain points that this user persona encountered navigating the product.


      Playwright Rules:
      - THE PLAYWRIGHT CODE MUST BE REAL TO NAVIGATE THE PRODUCT.
      - EVERY TIME YOU NAVIGATE TO A NEW PAGE, READ ALL AVAILABLE TEXT IN THE PAGE TO USER LATER THE CORRECT SELECTORS.
      - Use TypeScript for the code generated.
      - Return a export default function that could be imported and executed.
      - If you move to another page, make sure the code also works for that page.
      - Use "domcontentloaded" as waitUntil.
      - Make sure 100% all the selectors used in the code are present in the page.
      - Close the browser after the workflow is finished.
      - If a timeout is exceeded, do not throw an error, just continue with the next step.
      - The timeout is only 10 seconds.
      - Do not show errors or timeout errors in the console.
      - If an error is thrown mention that the user suffered an error in the step that wanted to execute in the pain points.
      - DO NOT ADD LOGS TO THE PLAYWRIGHT CODE.

      Use the following template for the code:

      "
        import { chromium, type Browser, type Page } from "playwright";

        export default async function executeProductWorkflow() {
          // Initialize browser
          const browser: Browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
          const page: Page = await browser.newPage();

          [CODE GENERATED HERE]
          }
      "

      Finally return all the pain points that this user persona encountered, such as wording, finding elements in the UI flow, etc. And concise solutions to fix them. For each pain point like-emoji.`,
